Oh, look! So much space to write on! I'm @Cpt-Squirrell (\*blush\*) and live in middle Sweden.

Been writing C++ since 2018 and been tech-savy since ~2010. That's the better part of my life for reference.
Gamer at heart and inventor in mind. Or at least I like to think of my clapping monkey brain as such.

I am certainly at a crossroads in life at the very moment. Standing between university, work, and voluntary conscription.
I suppose time will tell what faith I decide. Anyone reading this is also probably not getting an update for a long time.
Sorry not sorry. ✨
