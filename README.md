Oh, look! So much space to write on! I'm Arctifox! ðŸ‘‹

Been writing C++ since 2018 and been tech-savy since ~2010. That's the better part of my life for reference.
Gamer at heart and inventor in mind. Or at least I like to think of my clapping monkey brain as such.

I am currently studying innovative programming at LinkÃ¶ping University and will finish my bachelor in 2026. âœ¨
